# HackCU 2015

Welcome to HackCU. We are *very* excited about the first, hopefully not last,
edition of HackCU in Boulder, CO.

## Showing love to participants

The `hackcu_starrer` script will systematically star every teams
repository who participated at HackCU. Show some love to your peers by
running it!

```bash
$ sudo gem install octokit
$ ./hackcu_starrer
```

## Getting a Private Repository

Please open a pull request with some yaml metadata about your team in the
`teams/` folder.

```yaml
# teams/my_team_name.yml

name: MyTeamName
members:
  - johnsmith
  - myusername
  - foobarbazzer
```
